1. Create a middleware function that verifies if the user has the token in it's headers and if it hasnt expired yet.
(If it has expired) 
> it should redirect the user to the login page, 
(else) 
> refresh the token for another hour

2. Add a middleware function that verifies if the token was corrupted and adds that user's IP to a list that blocks
 their access to resources for an amount of time
